Part 3 depicts Logan "awakening". It starts with the mindscape process, which doesn't appear to do anything at first, consists of several incidents where weird things happen because Logan is casting without realizing it, and ends with Logan realizing he's responsible for all that weird shit happening, which leads to his proper "awakening". Notes on this part are below:

* The awakening process should be kinda dramatic, like Eero casting the No Big Deal spell was, but even moreso
* If I ever commission illustrations of Kitsune Logan's stories, I'd like the awakening scene to be on the shortlist
* That's it for now, I'm more focused on writing Parts 1 and 2 right now...

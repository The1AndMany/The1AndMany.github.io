	The early morning sunlight shone on Logan's face, waking him up. That was a really weird dream, he thought. He lay in bed for a few minutes, trying to wake himself up. I wonder if all humans would be that racist. I hope not. I hope that guy was just an outlier. Logan fantazised a moment about living in a world where humans not only existed, but lived alongside uprights. If the marvelous became mundane, perhaps it'd only be about as common as racism is in the real world, he reasoned. Although the reasoning behind it would probably be a lot more holier-than-thou. An alarm on Logan's phone started to ring. Just as well. Best not to follow this train of thought and bring religion into this. I'm sure it'd exist, but it might be a lot more stupid.
	Logan got down from his loft bed, turned the alarm off, and started his morning routine. <Logan starting to prepare for work, then stopping in his tracks when he hears Eero clearing his throat>
	<I'm gonna need a fair amount of description of Logan during his morning ritual>
	<Once his morning ritual is disrupted, Logan gets a better look at Eero, and I'm gonna have to describe that>
<Eero tries to explain by just saying "You summoned me in your sleep", but that's not enough>
<Eero asks if Logan knows increasingly simple things about magic, and when Logan reveals he thinks it's pronounced "man-uh" it becomes obvious that he has no idea about any of this>
<Eero gives a potted history of magic, summarizing as best he can but leaving lots out and massively over-simplifying>
	<He also notes that once Logan was safe in the dream, he tried to leave him in a positive situation, and the first thing that came to mind was the Stagecraft class>
<Logan asks what happens next, and Eero reveals the options>
	<Detail: Eero has no idea why in the world anyone would choose to keep their familiar around, especially if it was summoned accidentally>
<To Eero's surprise, Logan decides to keep him around, justifying it by saying that if he just dismisses Eero he might not ever be able to experience magic again>
<Eero warns against this choice given the "Magician's Code", which he calls the most important psuedo-law of Cunningfolk society, but ultimately respects the decision>
<Logan has to leave for work, and Eero can't follow yet, so Logan instructs Eero to figure out how to stick around without being noticed and also why Logan can't do anything magic on purpose>
<Logan tries to thank Eero, but doesn't know its name. Eero explains that he isn't named yet and that familiars usually aren't named, but when they are they're named by their masters. Logan objects to that term, but can't come up with a better one. In the meantime, Logan names Eero after the name he would give a pet>
<Logan leaves for work while Eero prepares to do some research>
<Chapter ends with Logan showing up 5 minutes late and blaming it on petsitting but wording it so he's not technically lying>
	<Something like: "Why are you late?" "I'm taking care of a pet for someone and I had to make sure it had everything it needed before I left.">

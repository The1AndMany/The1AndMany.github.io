* Starting with this section of filler, Logan can use the mana exchange I wrote out of part 1.
	* A copy/paste of the outline for that, as it appeared in the original outline for part 1, is below:
			* On the bus ride home, Eero says that once he learns magic Logan can trade unused mana for cash. There's a large market where Cunningfolk in need of quick mana for a high-cost spell can put up a listing allowing others to send their excess mana until they have the mana they need, at which point everyone who invested mana gets paid Norm money in an amount proportional to how much of the total they contributed
				* There's a ratio between total mana needed and total compensation given that's considered more or less fair, but mana is hard to quantify using precise numbers, so this ratio is kinda fuzzy
				* Logan immediately sees dollar signs, but Eero advises that since mana is so readily available (because it regenerates) nobody makes enough to live off of mana trading. Pretty much everyone who sells mana has a dayjob, and the extra money they make is usually used on minor non-essential things like video games
					* Logan is still optimistic, because if he can balance selling mana and keeping some to practice and learn new spells with he might be able to keep getting better at magic (which happens to have the side effect of increased mana regeneration rate, thus theoretically meaning more mana he can sell) while being able to fund his video game hobby and either save the unused money or just get more video games with it
				* One small caveat is that you have to send and receive the mana through a ley line, but the Cunningfolk government has set up a lot of them. The closest one actually runs under a coffee shop on the other side of town
					* Naturally, the name of the coffee shop is a reference to magic that can still refer to coffee: "Witch's Brew"
						* Note: Be sure to lampshade the fuck out of that very stupid pun
	* Further details I could add:
		* The owners/baristas (being Cunningfolk themselves and therefore not affected by the No Big Deal spell) provide a snack to Eero free of charge
			* Sort of like how some pet-friendly businesses will give you doggy treats (Dutch Bros. comes to mind), except this snack is basically just concentrated mana
		* The decor is magic themed, but going by magical stereotypes in order to avoid suspicion
			* This has the side effect of appearing to just be a coffee shop that mostly appeals to a niche crowd with an eccentric theme
				* That niche is magic enthusiasts, but not necissarily Cunningfolk
			* Logan should probably bring up that this is a little on-the-nose...
		* Maybe the owners of the Witch's Brew supplement their income by taking a cut of any mana transactions that take place there?
			* It would have to be obvious so that you know that you're giving a cut away
			* For the sake of hiding this from Norm tax enforcers, this is written off as a "tip"
			* Maybe this "fee" is waived as long as you keep ordering?
		* If Logan is based on me, he wouldn't really care for coffee. Maybe have him get a smoothie or an italian soda instead...
	* Side note: If I ever commission illustrations of anything from Kitsune Logan's stories, I'd like this scene to be on the shortlist

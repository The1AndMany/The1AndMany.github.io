Part 8 depicts Logan and Eero fusing into Leer and the immediate aftermath of that. It starts with the accidental fusion and consists of everyone including Leer trying to get used to the new form and the increased power it affords. I don't know how to end it yet, but it could potentially end with the secret of fusion being figured out and becoming the new craze (although I may save that for Part 9 so that I can write some intermission stories during the period between Leer fusing for the first time and fusion becoming widespread). Below are a few notes on what I should include:

* A couple points on Leer's physical appearance:
	* Leer's default form is a foxtaur (see below), but he is able to shapeshift (see below, different spot)
	* While Logan and Eero each had one normal tail, Leer has 9, and the tips of the tails fade into a starfield effect
		* Until I come up with a better way to describe it that doesn't use references, I'll just say that this looks about the same as the effect on the USB drive at the end of Lucy, except on the tip of a tail and with one of the edges (the one leading to the rest of the tail) being somewhat blurry.
	* Logan and Eero's fur patterns look more or less like normal feral foxes (anthropomorphized in Logan's case), but Leer's entire coat is a solid color somewhere between white, golden, and brown
	* Should Leer not have pupils?
* The fusion of two independent beings (and this counts because Eero can continue to exist without Logan) into one manifests in that fused being's head as two voices that both have control, kinda like split personality but both voices are present at once
	* When the two voices grow out of sync with each other, the fusion becomes unstable and is liable to separate at any moment
		* In Leer's case, he can feel himself desync every now and then (usually when under stress and debating with himself in his head), but since one of the component parts is already a representation of part of the other's brain it takes a lot more to desync
	* There's probably a better way to describe this, so until I can articulate it better just imagine something like Steven Universe fusion
* Fusion results in a physical form that's more-or-less a combination of the two subjects. Since both take the form of foxes the result is a fox as well, but since one is feral and one is anthro this results in a foxtaur appearance.
	* Furthermore, Eero was concentrated mana and the resulting fusion had a physical form that was ~50% pure mana, ~50% regular organic matter, which is a high enough concentration of mana to allow for shapeshifting
* This is the first time fusion has happened, so not only does Leer not know what's going on, but neither does any other Cunningperson. This is an entirely new type of magic, and nobody even knows how to replicate it!

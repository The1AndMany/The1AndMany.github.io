Starting with this filler gap, I could use a story to address how stupid "Chosen One" and "Destiny" plots are
	I could also place it in the next filler gap (Part 2.5) if I wanted to mention the resistance as the antagonist force the "chosen one" is supposed to defeat
	If I do this, I should make it 100% clear that not only is there no prophecy (as there's no future-sight magic), but if there was it would either be self-fulfilling or self-defeating because once a prophecy is written, it would only make sense for Chaos Theory to throw everything off and make the prophecy useless, either by having nobody believe in a self-fulfilling prophecy or having people believe in a self-defeating prophecy
	I may end up making fun of whatever character brings it up, or at least calling them an idiot
		Chances are that character will be audience-insertion, that particular audience being anyone who reads the parts leading up to this aside and expects a prophecy to get involved
			...whether they think that would help or ruin the story
		If I can get away with it without breaking the fourth wall, I should also mention that any writer worth their salt knows that "Chosen One" and "Destiny" plots are cliche, stupid, unrealistic, and a bunch of other mean words

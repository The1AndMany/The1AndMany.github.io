* Start with Mirror Logan as a base, branch point at a random point in his early 20's (I can decide the precise point later), only major differences are that he's living in a one bedroom apartment while I'm still living with my mom and he has an as-of-yet-undetermined minimum-wage part-time job while (at the time of writing) I'm unemployed
	* The actual branching point is whenever the first actual magic was cast, but since it was kept so secret it didn't really affect the Tree significantly, so the billed branching point is when Logan gets a job or moves out, whichever comes first assuming neither happens to Mirror Logan before the branching point because they happen to me
* Logan goes to sleep one night and has a nightmare. He's had nightmares before, but this one is so intense that he doesn't realize he's dreaming, can't wake up, and is legitimately fearing for his life
* Panicking (and not knowing that this isn't real), Logan's subconscious taps into a previously unknown instinct and summons a familiar. It shows up in the real world, realizes Logan must have summoned in his sleep because of a nightmare, and enters his dream to fix things
	* The audience only learns that the familiar showed up in the real world when Logan does when he wakes up and finds the familiar right next to him
	* This is when the familiar is first introduced to the reader, so be sure to describe it in detail
		* That includes size (about the same as a fox), fur color (similar to a real fox, but specifics are undecided so far), number of tails (leaning towards 1, 2, or all 9), and whether the tail tips are there (undecided)
			* This is the first opportunity to introduce the tail tips
* Logan is slightly amazed at the familiar's skill in saving him, but because he's in a dream and following dream logic at this point he just goes along with it and keeps dreaming like normal
	* Once the nightmare is back to a happy dream, the familiar exits Logan's dream and keeps him safe in the real world until he wakes up to dismiss him
* Logan wakes up the next morning to find that he's sleeping with the same kitsune he saw in his dream
	* He actually panics so much that he falls off his loft bed, but the kitsune casts a cloud landing pad to catch him
	* I'm calling the familiar a kitsune until they reveal that they're a familiar, calling them a familiar until Logan names them later, and using "they" pronouns until Logan gives a male name
		* If I decide they only have one tail I should refer to them as fox instead because there's no real indication of being a kitsune aside from knowing magic, which is coincidental
* The kitsune explains that Logan summoned them in his sleep and seems to think that will be enough, but Logan is even more confused because now the kitsune is talking
* Logan says he has no idea what's going on, and it slowly dawns on the kitsune that they were summoned subconsciously, and that Logan has no idea that magic actually exists
* The kitsune tries to summarize that magic exists, Logan can cast it, and he may not consciously know how but he does subconsciously, and Logan seems to understand
	* He doesn't believe it quite yet, but he at least comprehends the circumstances
* Logan asks "What happens now?" and the familiar says that's up to him; Logan could either dismiss them or keep them around
	* Initially, the familiar has no idea why he would choose the latter
	* The kitsune also explains that it can't leave until it's dismissed
* Logan considers his options, and decides that if he just dismisses the familiar this could be the end of his adventure with magic, as there's no guarantee he'll ever do that again, consciously or not. He decides to keep the familiar around, and explains that maybe it can teach him how to do magic on purpose
* The familiar respects their master's decision, but admits they have no idea how to teach him magic
	* Normally someone unlocks their magic potential on their own, which is more of an art than a science, and once they do they innately know some basic spells that they can build on. Since Logan hasn't unlocked his magic potential (despite having used magic by accident), there's not much he can do about it
* The familiar promises to try to find a way to unlock Logan's magic potential for him, but can't guarantee they'll actually learn anything. Logan is fine with this, because even if he can't use magic himself he can still become friends with someone who can, and that's pretty damn cool
* The familiar realizes Logan wouldn't know that magic is supposed to be kept a secret from everyone who doesn't know how to use it (officially called "magically challenged", but often derogatively referred to as "Norms" (short for "Normals")) and warns Logan that it's not like they can be seen together in public
* Logan considers this warning. Luckily, it's his day off, so he has some time to consider an alternative. In the meantime, he instructs the familiar to learn what they can about ways to unlock Logan's magic potential, which they do through a spell that allows magic users to interact metaphysically
	* In explaining what they're going to do, the familiar introduces the term Cunningfolk, which is what the magic users refer to themselves as, and is derived from a word that is basically a synonym for "witch", but with a positive connotation
	* The familiar also mentions that there's no physical meeting place for Cunningfolk, mostly for secrecy reasons, and this metaphysical communication is the central nexus for Cunningfolk society
	* The familiar also mentions that it'll look like they're asleep, but they can still hear and talk with Logan, should something come up
* Logan and the familiar work on their own for a little while, then Logan comes up with an idea. He's about to express this idea to the familiar but he realizes he doesn't know their name, so he waits until they finish with the metaphysical spell before saying anything
* Time passes, and the familiar "wakes up". Before the familiar can relay what they learned, Logan explains that he didn't know their name so he had to wait. The familiar explains that they don't have a name because Logan hasn't named them yet. After some consideration, Logan decides on the name Eero because of its rarity and the fact that it's what he would have named a pet if he had one
* Eero relays the information that it learned. Apparently this has never happened before, but the common theory is that Eero should use a spell to create what's called a "Mindscape", then make whatever new connections are necessary to allow the part that knows magic to be used consciously. He even researched other people's mindscapes so he knows what connections to make and avoid making. It would drain most of the mana he has saved up, which would leave him super weak, but it could totally be done right now
	* Eero also pronounces mana "mah-nah", which is the conventional pronunciation within Cunningfolk circles
* Logan is excited at the prospect of being able to cast magic right away, but is worried it might not work and might in fact damage his brain. Eero admits to the former, but says that every time this spell is cast a "before" image of the mindscape is saved so that if something happens things can automatically revert back
	* Kind of like changing display settings on a computer. When you hit "OK" or "Apply" it changes the settings, pops up a confirmation window, and starts a timer. If you can't hit the confirmation button before the timer hits zero, the computer assumes that the display isn't working with the new settings and reverts things back to how they were
* Before Logan commits to that option, he asks Eero if a certain spell exists by describing its effects: Anything affected by the spell will go unnoticed by those who don't know exactly what they're looking for, and if someone does notice they'll dismiss it either as unimportant or as normal or as someone else's problem
	* Logan calls this concept "dream logic" because in a non-lucid dream you could subconsciously go "Flying castles made of sand? Sure, and let's throw in zombies while we're at it," and your conscious mind will usually just go with it without a second thought until you wake up, think back to what was in your dream, and possibly question your sanity
* Eero suggests a spell called "No Big Deal"
	* This spell has two variants, one for anything related to magic and another for flat-out everything
		* These two variants each have two sub-variants for hiding from just Norms or hiding from everyone
	* This spell (and all it's variants) can be countered with another spell called "Seeing the Big Picture", but it only applies to whoever it's been cast on
		* I.E. you can't expose something for everyone, just those you cast the counter-spell on (and it's impossible to cast the counter-spell on everyone because of mana limitations)
* Logan asks if it's possible to cast the magic-related, just Norms variant of No Big Deal, and Eero says it would cost about the same amount of mana to initially cast, but there's also a constant drain as longs as it stays in effect
	* That drain is ultimately less than the rate at which Eero collect mana, but it does considerably decrease the net increase rate
	* Logan then asks if there's any chance of the No Big Deal spell failing, and Eero says there haven't been any cases of the spell failing, but it's almost never used because the mana drain is pretty large
* Logan ponders his options for a moment: Either he (possibly) learns magic but has to keep it a huge secret, or he can't use magic himself and must cast spells using Eero as an intermediary but doesn't have to worry about protecting the secrecy of magic
* Logan ends up choosing the latter, despite Eero's warnings, for a few reasons:
	* There's no guarantee the mindscape tactic will work
	* He's not sure he would be able to keep such a big secret without something like No Big Deal in place as a safeguard
	* He'd rather be introduced to magic by being able to witness it for a while before getting the chance to use it himself so that he has some time to wrap his head around how magic works before being able to use it, allowing him to start casting with a theoretically lower risk of accidents and a theoretically higher starting proficiency
	* He has secretly fantasized before about having a supernatural friend while still being completely normal himself, and would like to give that fantasy a chance to happen for real
* Eero warns Logan against this option one last time, but ultimately must do what his master demands
	* Logan objects to being called that. He'd like to go by first names, but if they must refer to their relationship he'd rather be called Eero's caster, because that doesn't have so much implication of dominance and he wants to see Eero as an equal
		* He would still call Eero his familiar
		* He also not-so-secretly hopes that Eero eventually sees him as an equal as well
* Eero casts the spell (go into a lot of detail here)
	* Detail: Whenever a Cunningperson casts a very complex spell for their skill level (this spell counting because Eero is only as good as Logan is, and Logan has no idea what he's doing)...
		* ...their eyes lose their pupils and glow white
			* They can also do this on command by using a variant of the shapeshifting spell, but it's involuntary when you're pushing your limits
		* ...they start floating
		* ...particle effects surround them
	* Detail: As the casting finishes, particles surround whatever the spell is being cast on (in this case both Eero and Logan), form a semi-transparent field, then fade
* Upon the completion of the cast, Eero drops to the floor and collapses. Logan immediately goes to check on him. He's still breathing, but he can barely talk long enough to explain that he needs to rest for a few hours. Logan lifts him onto his loft bed so he'll be more comfortable and says to let him know if there's anything he can do to speed up the recovery
* Hours pass, and Logan can't really focus on doing anything because he's worried about Eero. Eventually he decides to make Eero something to eat, hoping that will help him out. He fixes up a couple of frozen TV dinners. Eero finds the strength to eat, and after finishing thanks Logan because that actually did help
* Eero still isn't feeling well yet, so Logan tries (unsuccessfully) to distract himself with video games, then curls up next to Eero to go to sleep
	* Eero isn't feeling well enough to enter Logan's dream, and very much wishes he could
* The next morning Eero is feeling well enough to get up and move around, but he finds it difficult to walk. Logan decides to carry Eero around in his backpack with his head poking out
* It happens to be Saturday, so Logan is expected to volunteer at his local library. Eero asks to come along to test the bounds of the No Big Deal spell
* The two engage in a conversation in full earshot of other volunteers and nobody notices anything
	* They prove that nobody really cares what they're saying or that there's a talking fox in the room something like this:
		* Eero: Logan, does magic exist?
		* Logan: Yes, it does, and I'm talking to a magic fox. *Turns to another volunteer* Francis, do you think magic exists?
		* Francis: No, I haven't seen any proof of it. I would like to hope that it does, though.
		* Logan: Would actual talking animals count as proof?
		* Francis: I suppose...
		* Logan: Have you seen any?
		* Francis: What a silly question. Of course not.
	* At one point the topic of Eero's physiology comes up, and it turns out Eero is actually made of concentrated mana
		* If Eero doesn't have a digestive tract, Logan wonders whether eating something last night helped at all. Eero explains that it did because he was able to convert the matter of the food into mana, which replenished his reserves somewhat, and once his reserves are fully replenished he'll be good as new
			* Detail: Casting so much magic that you have to dip into your reserves will physically harm you. Deplete your reserves completely and you die
		* Logan wonders why Eero happens to be a fox, and Eero says it's simply because that's the form that Logan (probably reflexively) summoned him as
			* Eero can also use a shapeshift spell to change his form, but it works differently since he has no default form. The spell only costs what mana it takes to catalyze the reaction, plus enough mana to concentrate into more mass
				* Familiars can only get about 10% of this mass back if they shift into something smaller, so most familiars stick to one form because changing forms is terribly inefficient
				* Logan immediately asks if he can use the shapeshift spell on himself once he can cast magic, and Eero says he can but there would be a relatively small but still significant mana drain to maintain the form
	* Eero decides to ask what Logan's job is and how he does it, intentionally not letting himself just check the answer by checking Logan's mind
		* His reasoning (at this point) is that if Logan wants to form a bond as badly as he appears to (and that's pretty obvious) the least Eero can do is humor him
		* Detail: Logan's volunteer work is exactly the same as I have at EPL
* The two head home after Logan's two-hour shift because Logan doesn't have friends to hang out with or any extra money to go do something on his own
* Since Logan now knows that eating actually does regenerate mana, once they're home he decides to cook frozen pizza for two. Eero eats it and thanks Logan again, but mentions that he can sustain himself through mana and that it's not really going to regenerate enough to justify wasting money on extra food. Logan figured this, but doesn't care. He can't help but care for Eero, and one of the reflexive things uprights do when they care for someone is feed them. It just feels wrong to let something under your care not eat, even if you know they don't need to
	* Eero openly decides to not bring it up again until his reserves are filled again, partly because he really does want to reach that point faster (even if only marginally) but mostly because he still wants to play along for Logan's sake
	* Logan asks whether he'll be able to sustain himself through mana alone, and Eero says yes but that's an advanced spell that he probably won't learn for at least a year. Logan simultaneously is disappointed and can't wait for the point he learns that spell
* Days pass. Logan continues to take Eero out in public when he goes to work or volunteering (again, he doesn't really have any friends or money, so he doesn't go out much), making (mostly frozen) meals for two, and learning more about the ins and outs of magic. Eero continues testing the bounds of the No Big Deal spell, playing along with Logan wanting to become friends, and offering all the magic knowledge he can get ahold of and convey to someone who can't cast magic themselves. The two begin to form a bond that extends beyond Logan casting Eero; a bond that has the hallmarks of a burgeoning friendship
* About a week later, Logan is approached as he's walking to the bus stop that would take him home from work by a man with an excessively long beard in a deep blue suit with a star-patterned tie. The suit confirms Logan's identity and asks if that's his fox. Logan isn't quite sure how to respond, so he just responds yes. The suit responds back by teleporting them all to a log cabin in the middle of nowhere that's serving as a temporary court
* As it turns out, the Cunningfolk government is putting Logan on trial for irresponsible use of mana, inhumane treatment of a familiar, and several counts of recklessly endangering the secrecy of magic
	* The first for choosing the No Big Deal spell rather than try to catalyze learning magic with the Mindscape, the second because it actually hurts a lot to have such little mana in your reserves and Eero could have just stopped existing to stop the pain, and the third because nobody had pushed the No Big Deal spell as far as they have so there was no telling how effective it would be under greater stress and being any less effective risks someone seeing through the spell
* Logan surprises everyone by pleading not guilty on all counts, and surprises Eero in particular by taking the stand in his own defense despite not being able to cast magic himself
* Logan's defense is as follows:
	* On the count of irresponsible use of mana, Logan concedes that the Mindscape would be a more valid use of mana, but fails to see how choosing the No Big Deal option is less responsible. He made sure that the spell worked before choosing that option, and had no reason to think that it wouldn't. He did his due diligence and as long as the choice of spell is valid (which this still was, but the Mindscape would have been moreso) that should be considered responsible.
	* On the count of inhumane treatment of a familiar, Logan admitted he pushed Eero to his limit, but Eero gave no indication beforehand that he would be in pain or how dangerous it actually was. In fact, Eero recommended using the Mindscape spell which, according to Eero, would have taken about the same amount of mana, and he must have realized that if Logan chose that option he'd need to stick around at least long enough to get him in touch with another Cunningperson willing to guide him. As such, Eero was ready and willing to put himself through self-harm and didn't mention anything to Logan. Sure, he put Eero through a lot of pain, but he didn't know it would hurt and did everything he could to make it up to Eero. It wouldn't make sense if someone was convicted of ethics violations for something they didn't mean to do and regretted heavily after the fact
	* On the count of recklessly endangering the secrecy of magic, Logan realized that since a familiar is an extension of its caster he'd be held accountable for anything Eero did. That said, Logan had Eero take the stand, which had never been admitted as evidence in a Cunningfolk trial before. The court allowed it on the grounds that (in this case) Eero truly would know more about what sort of safeguards were in place. Eero testified that he wasn't reckless. Eero could tell how much strain the No Big Deal spell was under at any given time, and he set an invisibility spell to automatically cast if the No Big Deal spell wavered at all. He also set an emergency teleport spell to automatically cast if the invisibility spell didn't work. In the event that the teleport spell didn't work he would telepathically urge Logan to dismiss him, and in the event he couldn't establish a telepathic link he would immediately disable all safeguards and expel his entire mana reserve, quickly and painfully causing him to decompose until he was gone. He didn't tell Logan about this other than to say that he had safeguards in place and if he disappears that's why. When asked about the intense amount of pain he'd go through in the last safeguard, he said that it would be worth it to keep magic a secret, and that Logan would just have to understand that if it happened he wouldn't be able to learn magic. Logan was shocked to hear this, and said that it might take him a while but he would understand and get over it, but he would never forget what might have been.
* In his closing statement, Logan said that he didn't make his choices without carefully considering the options, and it follows that Eero would be just as cautious since he's an extension of Logan's mind. The two did their due diligence to look into all consequences and alternatives before every decision, and were willing to give some self-sacrifice to do what was right. They did what, to the best of their knowledge, was the best thing to do, and asking any more than that would be unreasonable
	* Detail: During the trial Eero witnesses just how much he cared about being able to continue living the life he had been living for the past week. He realizes that it's not just because of the idea of being able to use magic, but also because Logan actually does care about him. With how feverently Logan was defending both of their choices, it was clear he wasn't going to let anyone put an end to his new way of life without a fight
* The jury deliberated for 3 weeks, during which Logan was allowed to return to his normal life but wasn't allowed to interact with Eero. Needless to say, the two couldn't get each other off of their minds.
	* Detail: Eero considers establishing a telepathic link just to get to "talk" to Logan, but decides against it because it'll probably get them in more trouble. He's not sure whether he cares whether Logan gets in trouble because he's Logan's familiar or because he's starting to actually form a friendship, which is an unprecedented phenomenon for a familiar
	* Detail: Over those 3 weeks, Eero naturally regenerates the rest of his magic reserves. By the time the verdict comes in, he's feeling as well as he was when he was first summoned
* The jury finds Logan not guilty on all counts, and since the No Big Deal spell is still in effect Eero can't help but teleport to Logan, jump on him, knock him to the ground, and give him big sloppy kisses on the face. Logan can't help but hug back and laugh in happy disbelief
* A court liaison (who happens to be the same bearded man in a suit who took them to the trial) follows Eero and explains the verdict to Logan, but warns the two not to push the No Big Deal spell that far again unless they're in a controlled environment, and warns Eero specifically to disclose any self-harm that may happen from depleting mana reserves. The two agree wholeheartedly, and after the suit leaves quickly get to business catching up on the past 3 weeks
	* Detail: Last lines:
		* Eero: I'm glad that's over.
		* Logan: Same. Now, then. You and I have a lot of catching up to do.

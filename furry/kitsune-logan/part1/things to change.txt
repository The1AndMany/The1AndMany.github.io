Shortlist of specific things to change:
* I should work the answers to the six basic questions about magic into the story somehow
	* see "Magic systems - 6 questions.txt"
* The deliberation of the trial takes several months (if not years) because the topic is so complex that it actually took that long to come to a conclusion everyone could agree on. In that time Logan has been completely out of the loop, and so much time has passed that he thinks none of it was real, not only because they should have reached a verdict by now, but also because now that he's looking he should be seeing magic all over the place. Even so, the whole experience hasn't been forgotten and in the back of his mind (and often spilling over into the front whenever he gets a chance to daydream) he wonders what his life would be like if he could actually use magic as Eero made him understand it.
	* The actual reason he doesn't see magic is because everyone is using No Big Deal spells, and for the purposes of that spell those who know about magic but aren't awakened (like Logan) count as "Norm"
	* Logan gets out of this whole funk when he and Eero reunite and he accepts that it might be real after all
		* Side note: I'm really looking forward to writing this story, and the reunion scene in particular
* I need to remove the "mana exchange" bit and put it somewhere where I can use it later
	* It won't come into play until at least Part 3.5
* I should introduce Logan's old friend (who I haven't named yet but am basing off of Rico's wolf)
	* This friend was awakened before he met Logan, but came to believe that nothing good can come from using magic, so he never used it or even mentioned it. He and Logan had a falling out (how?) before the beginning of this saga, but they still live in the same city. By chance, the friend sees Logan in public and notices Eero because the No Big Deal spell doesn't affect him because he's awakened. He goes over to warn Logan about the road he's going down, but Logan's an optimist and doesn't agree. Regardless, the two decide to respect each other's opinions and try not to discuss magic in front of each other. The two mend fences and agree to get together sometime.
		* This is setup for the friend choosing to side with the Norms at the end of Part 2, which in turn is setup for the Norms having the superweapon in Part 6
			* Basically, I just needed an answer to the plot hole where in order to have a superweapon the Norms must have done some research into magic, which seems against their MO. This way we can have what is essentially a double agent, knowing enough about magic to be able to do research on it, while at the same time disliking magic enough to want to destroy it.
			* Just to make sure I've written this down somewhere where I'll do something about it, Logan comes up with a way to generate infinite electricity using teleportation magic (specifically a portal spell causing an infinite loop, dropping something magnetic in the loop, and wrapping a bunch of wire around that to create an infinite generator), pitches it to the Cunningfolk, the Cunningfolk regect it because they worry the Norms might backstab them by using it to power the superweapon, Logan contacts his friend and convinces him that magic can be used for good (using this generator as an example), he and the friend try to dismantle the superweapon, it malfunctions, the friend sacrifices himself by letting it release its charge on a singular target, thus wiping all of his mana, the two make sure the superweapon can never be built again, then the friend acts as an inside man to offer the generator idea to the Norms now that they can't backstab with it, (Logan possibly gets a lot of royalties for coming up with the idea,) magic no longer has a negative connotation so nobody needs to use the No Big Deal spell anymore, and the friend decides to part ways again because now he's the first upright to not have any mana, making him the first true Norm, so he believes that means he's not really suited to live in Logan's world where magic permeates everything he does.
* Before the trial, I should bring up the fact that to the layman (and most Norms) magic law can be summarized in a concept called "The Magician's Oath"
	* "As a magician I promise never to reveal the secret of any illusion to a non-magician, unless that one swears to uphold the Magician's Oath in turn. I promise never to perform any illusion for any non-magician without first practicing the effect until I can perform it well enough to maintain the illusion of magic."
		* It is permissible to reveal secrets to those determined to learn magic and become magicians, typically starting with smaller tricks then moving into increasingly valuable and lesser known secrets
		* Breaking the Oath, whether by simply telling someone the secret or not practicing enough to maintain the illusion, will make other magicians less willing to give up their secrets. You are also no longer eligible to join the IBM (International Brotherhood of Magicians) and are "banned from magic society."
		* This oath could be applied in similar form to a number of things. It's designed for stage magic, but it could apply to real magic, secret societies, or really anything that requires keeping a secret.
		*Sometimes what seems like someone revealing a magical secret could be another form of misdirection

* Convert "kitsune logan thoughts.txt" into several short story plot outlines
* Revise those outlines
	* They need to be optimized for the shorter format
		* I'm thinking the trial should be divided into three parts:
			* Getting summoned for the trial should be put in the ending of whatever story I put before it
			* The trial itself should be its own story, ending when the deliberation begins and Logan and Eero are separated
			* The reveal of the verdict and the scene where Logan and Eero reunite should be its own story
				* Since I'm changing format to a short story, I could rewrite it so that this portion follows Logan's "Norm" day, reminicing about what might have been if he could still use magic, then right around the end Eero pounces on him, knocking him backwards, and giving a hug as best he can with feral fox anatomy, which Logan returns
					* If I want to get a little more drama out of this, I could have the deliberation take several months, if not years, convincing Logan that none of it was real (because if it was the trial surely would have been resolved by now (the only reason it hasn't is because the topic is so complex they're still debating)), but it remains in the back of his mind and makes him constantly wonder how life would be if magic existed (which it does)
	* They need some general revision
		* I should remove the "mana trade" bit and save it somewhere for when I actually use it
			I wouldn't even be able to use it until part 3.5
		* I should answer 6 basic questions when establishing that magic exists. I've already come up with answers, and I should work them into the revisions
* Get things structured into parts and chapters
	* Each overarching storyline will be a "part"
	* Each intermediary part between major story arcs will be half-parts
		* e.g. "Part 2.5" would take place between parts 2 and 3
	* Each whole part's stories will be arranged into numbered chapters so that the order is preserved
		* Half-parts don't need chapters because the stories that make up the half-parts are one-offs. Location in the timeline isn't important other than "between parts X and Y".
* Begin structuring the furry portion of the website to match the part/chapter structure
	* Probably just folders for each part with each text file is named "Chapter X - <chapter name here>.txt"
		* I imagine all this would be in a subfolder
			* I imagine a structure like "~/furry/kitsune-logan/partX" with prefaces in the furry and kitsune-logan directories that state the framing device
				* Speaking of which, the overall framing device for the furry bits I can't put in the Case Archives might need reworking too
	* Put a note somewhere on what each part's story arc will be so I don't forget
* Begin rewriting Part 1 based on revised outlines
* Once I have about half of Part 1 completed, I should start considering whether or not to publish
	* Criteria for publish-ready:
		* The basics of magic (i.e. the 6 questions) are firmly established
		* At least half of Part 1 has been written
		* The framing device is ready and readme files are in place explaining...
			* the study as a whole
			* the Kitsune Logan part of the study
				* This includes the format of Parts with Chapters and intermediary Parts with one-off stories
		* Favorable peer-review
* Once the beginning is published, publish at most one new chapter a week
* Once I run out of finished stories, begin writing more

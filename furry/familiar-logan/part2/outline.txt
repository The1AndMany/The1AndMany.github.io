Part 2 depicts Logan actually learning about the Norm resistance, who have taken it upon themselves to "eradicate" any Cunningfolk they identify. It starts with an old friend of Logan reaching out in order to recruit him for a resistance movement against magic, consists of Logan going on an undercover mission to the resistance HQ, and ends with Logan saying "Thanks, but no thanks" and the friend giving a warning that learning magic may not be worth it because of the bueraucracy involved. Below are some notes on what to include:

Very rough outline:
* I'm thinking Logan's friend reaches out over text to try and recruit him for the resistance. Logan feigns disbelief in magic in order to sound believable, and the friend ends up inviting Logan over to the resistance headquarters in order to prove it. Before committing, Logan gets in touch with the Cunningfolk who are supposed to keep an eye on him until he proves himself competent and relays this info. (Side note: they had no idea who the leader of the resistance was up until now, and it turns out the friend used to be a Cunningperson but was shunned when they broke The Magician's Oath in order to save lives) The Cunningfolk know they could use this as the first ever undercover operation, so they tell Logan to go along with it while Eero uses a spell to see things through Logan's eyes and relays it to the Cunningfolk in real-time, while also delivering requests via telepathy. Logan agrees, and the story that sets up the arc ends with Logan texting his friend to say yes.
	* Eero would be on a constant diet of extra mana so he doesn't overexert himself
	* Next story begins with Logan showing up at the headquarters without Eero with no idea what to expect, then subsequent stories delve into how each part of the resistance works
		* Currently not entirely sure what parts to feature
		* Also, Logan's friend may be the founder of the resistance, but he's not the only voice at the top. He does guide a lot of what the resistance does, but any order has to be agreed upon by everyone in power.
		* Final story ends with Logan saying "Thanks, but no thanks" because he wasn't convinced that magic is a bad thing
			* He just thinks that getting in trouble for saving lives was a beuracracy issue. Magic can do good, and indeed it did, but prioritizing secrecy above all else makes all that potential moot. Wanting to eradicate all magic because of beuracracy doesn't make sense. He could at the very least have become a magic vigilante.
				* Logan mentions this, but the friend knows that any good he did would also be subject to Norm laws, and very little of what good he could do would be considered legal. If magic weren't secret, legislation about magic could allow him to do more good, but that's not going to happen. Who would believe him?
			* The friend respects Logan's opinion, but warns him that if he ever wants to use magic himself, it may not be worth it because he'll have to deal with bueraucracy.
			* Logan ends up walking away from this whole experience not sure whether to trust the Cunningfolk government, but deciding to play along and bide his time. Maybe he can find a way to give magic back some of its lost potential?

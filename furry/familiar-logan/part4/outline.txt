Part 4 depicts Logan going to prison because he was found out as a Cunningperson. It starts with the arrest, consists of learning more about the resistance, socializing with other prisoners, and possibly the occasional torture, and ends with Eero breaking him out. Below are some notes on this part:

* The prison break will probably borrow heavily from the prison break I outlined for "You Look Familiar"
* I want to incorporate a scene near the beginning where Logan and his friend from Part 2 have a discussion
	* The friend should claim that the magic prison wasn't his idea
	* The friend should wonder out loud whether Logan was working undercover for the Cunningfolk government in Part 2, but because it's not a direct question Logan doesn't answer it
	* The friend should admit that they put Logan under surveilance since their meeting in Part 2, but could only get bits and pieces because he sent Norms who ended up getting affected by the No Big Deal spell
		* He was still able to deduce that Logan had "awakened", which was probable cause to lock him up
* That's it for now, because I'm focusing on writing prior Parts first...

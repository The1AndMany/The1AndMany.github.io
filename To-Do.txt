Critical - Solve before launch:
	Viewing on a library computer disables Hack. This appears to be because the library computer (only somewhat understandably) disables external font files. That said, I should adjust the site so the courier and monospace failsafes look good too
		I've replaced all spaces with a Figure Space character, so I need to check on the library computer again to see whether it looks right
			Of course, that'll only appear if I push these changes to the main branch
	Edit "WT - Oneironaut.txt", then eventually finalize it
		I took notes on what feedback I've gotten and placed them at the top of the .txt file
	More content!
		I'm thinking 2-3 more stories after finalizing the oneironaut one before launching
	Rewrite the splash page for launch
	Get a domain (I'm thinking lowrezlabs.net)

Stuff that can wait until after launch:
	Perpetually add more content
	Figure out a solution for if there's more entries than would fit on one page
	Figure out some way to automatically update for new content without having to manually edit the .html files (Maybe some .css magic?)
		This will be complicated somewhat when I accumulate more than one page of entries, because I'll have to split into multiple pages
	Figure out some way to allow navigating the website using only text commands
		Think the visual design of the station menus in the original Elite, but interacting using command line-esque prompts
		I plan to keep the click-interaction intact
		I need to figure out how to have the typed text display in Hack

Critical - Solve before launch:
	I should adjust the site so the courier and monospace failsafes look good too
		The new issue is that IE displays these characters at 5/6 width when using a monospace font, unless it's Hack
			Honestly, fuck IE, but I need to code for edge cases. Current edge case is if the @font-space function doesn't work and the user either has to be on IE or refuses to use anything other browser
	Edit "WT - Oneironaut.txt", then eventually finalize it
		I took notes on what feedback I've gotten and placed them at the top of the .txt file
	More content!
		I'm thinking 2-3 more stories after finalizing the oneironaut one before launching
	Rewrite the splash page for launch
	Get a domain (I'm thinking lowrezlabs.net)

Stuff that can wait until after launch:
	Perpetually add more content
	Figure out a solution for if there's more entries than would fit on one page
	Figure out some way to automatically update for new content without having to manually edit the .html files (Maybe some .css magic?)
		This will be complicated somewhat when I accumulate more entries than would fit on one page (see above)
	Figure out some way to allow navigating the website using only text commands
		Think the visual design of the station menus in the original Elite, but interacting using command line-esque prompts
		I plan to keep the click-interaction intact
		I need to figure out how to have the typed text display in Hack

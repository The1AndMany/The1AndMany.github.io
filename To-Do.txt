* Perpetually add more content
	* Don't worry too hard about making sure there's always something new. This is just a pet project, after all
	* I could assign point values to each bit of work I do and aim to get a certain number of points per day, while rolling over extra points until I reach half of my point goal for the next day
		* Essentially the system I used to get the lead out and actually get myself to get the site ready for a public launch
* Add a custom 404 error page
	* Don't let Google index it; make sure it's configured to give a 404 HTTP status code when non-existent pages are requested
* Figure out how to display content properly if a user is on IE/Edge and Hack can't be used
	* Currently, IE/Edge displays the Figure Space characters at 5/6 width when using a monospace font, unless it's Hack
	* Reminder: Using multiple regular spaces in a row gets collapsed to display as only one space
		* Not just on IE/Edge; also on Chrome, and presumably Firefox
* Figure out a solution for if there's more entries than would fit on one page
* Figure out some way to automatically update for new content without having to manually edit the .html files
	* This will be complicated somewhat when I accumulate more entries than would fit on one page (see above)
	* (See server-side code note below)
* Figure out some way to allow navigating the website using only text commands
	* Think the current visual design, but interacting using command line-esque prompts
	* I plan to keep the click-interaction intact
	* There should be some error handler for if a command is unrecognized
	* This would all have to fit into the established aesthetic as well
		* That means the typed text should appear in-line and in Hack
	* (See server-side code note below)

Notes:
(Server-side code)
	Github pages doesn't support server-side code (PHP, Ruby, Python, etc.), which this feature may require. If it does I would have to use a "proper" web host, which would almost certainly cost money. I should weigh whether it would be worth worth actually paying for a web host for what benefits I reap, including commercial purposes and adding this feature.
		I should also be sure that the feature works by testing locally before deciding anything based on it
		Just to be clear, Javascript counts as client-side code

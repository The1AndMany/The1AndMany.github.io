Critical - Solve before launch:
  Viewing on a library computer disables Hack. This could be because of the library computer itself not allowing remote font files, or it could be because hosting using GitHub Pages only allows for "static assets". I should test on a non-library computer without Hack installed, troubleshoot, and problem-solve.
    Maybe I could figure out how to code so that it displays a message if Hack can't be used
    I'm thinking I should at least go from 3/4-width spaces to full-width spaces, I just don't know which character to use
      I can look it up...
      Mostly for the sake of the monospace failsafe
  Edit "WT - Oneironaut.txt", then eventually finalize it
    I took notes on what feedback I've gotten and placed them at the top of the .txt file
  More content!
    I'm thinking 2-3 more stories after the oneironaut one before launching
  Rewrite the splash page for launch
  Get a domain (I'm thinking lowrezlabs.net)

Stuff that can wait until after launch:
  Perpetually add more content
  Figure out a solution for if there's more entries than would fit on one page
  Figure out some way to automatically update for new content without having to manually edit the .html files (Maybe some .css magic?)
    This will be complicated somewhat when I accumulate more than one page of entries, because I'll have to split into multiple pages
  Figure out some way to allow navigating the website using only text commands
    Think the visual design of the station menus in the original Elite, but interacting using command line-esque prompts
    I plan to keep the click-interaction intact
    I need to figure out how to have the typed text display in Hack

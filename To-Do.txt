Critical - Resolve before launch:
	Edit and finalize "WT - Oneironaut.txt", or remove it from the repository
		I took notes on what feedback I've gotten and placed them at the top of the .txt file
		With the extent of the changes, a total rewrite may be easier than going through and spot-editing
		I don't have to have this story in the public launch. I could replace it with another.
	More content!
		I currently have 6 stories ready to go, and I'm aiming to have at least 7 at launch
			This means that I should get 1 more story ready before launching
			I could always postpone the launch for whatever reason (possibly saving money for the domain); I don't need exactly 7 stories to launch
			Oneironaut currently counts as "not ready" because it needs some massive rewriting
			The Dog Therapy miniseries currently counts as "not ready" because it needs a better overall title, it needs titles for each entry, and entries 2-4 need to be expanded to match the length of entry 1 as closely as possible (plus peer-review after all that)
	I should migrate the Stream Shuffle and Permissions documents from my Dropbox to a "credits" folder on the server, add "Public Interface Credits.txt" to it, and redirect any old links
		Currently the only existing links are in the draft Twitch channel description
	Maybe add a quick file listing every website I am a part of
		Basically copying "Dropbox/Text files/Transfer/sites.txt" and maybe adapting it to HTML
	One final peer-review of the entire site
	Get a domain (I'm thinking lowrezlabs.net)

Stuff that can wait until after launch:
	Perpetually add more content
		Don't worry too hard about making sure there's always something new. This is just a pet project, after all
	Figure out how to display content properly if a user is on IE/Edge and Hack can't be used
		Currently, IE/Edge displays the Figure Space characters at 5/6 width when using a monospace font, unless it's Hack
		Reminder: Using multiple regular spaces in a row gets collapsed to display as only one space
			Not just on IE/Edge; also on Chrome, and presumably Firefox
	Figure out a solution for if there's more entries than would fit on one page
		(See Javascript note below)
	Figure out some way to automatically update for new content without having to manually edit the .html files
		This will be complicated somewhat when I accumulate more entries than would fit on one page (see above)
		(See Javascript note below)
		(See server-side code note below)
	Figure out some way to allow navigating the website using only text commands
		Think the current visual design, but interacting using command line-esque prompts
		I plan to keep the click-interaction intact
		There should be some error handler for if a command is unrecognized
		This would all have to fit into the established aesthetic as well
			That means the typed text should appear in-line and in Hack
		(See Javascript note below)
		(See server-side code note below)

Notes:
(Javascript)
	Just as a reminder, IE/Edge doesn't run Javascript automatically, and the dialog to enable it disappears after a few seconds. This could theorhetically be solved by setting it so that there's failsafe content that displays if Javascript can't run and that fits with my aesthetic.
(Server-side code)
	Github pages doesn't support server-side code (PHP, Ruby, Python, etc.), which this feature may require. If it does I would have to use a "proper" web host, which would almost certainly cost money. I should weigh whether it would be worth worth actually paying for a web host for what benefits I reap, including commercial purposes and adding this feature.
		I should also be sure that the feature works by testing locally before deciding anything based on it
		Just to be clear, Javascript counts as client-side code

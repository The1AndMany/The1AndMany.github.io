<!-- If you're reading this, then you just hacked the site only to find out that this login page is a farce.
Don't tell anyone, but LRL personnel can't actually login on anything but their Portal Device.
Well, aside from me, but that's entirely because I have a hardware uplink installed on any device I regularly use,
and the uplink on my phone is set to tether any computer it's plugged into, like if I'm at a library or a friend's house.
I just put this here for narrative purposes. Sorry for getting your hopes up enough that you felt the need to hack.
I may add a little area with a little extra content for those clever enough to hack into it, but probably not. -->

<!-- Also, since you're here...

We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy

I just want to tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand

Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it
Inside we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it

And if you ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too blind to see

Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it
Inside we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it

I just want to tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand

Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Sorry, but I felt the need to punish someone who goes this far to hack LRL. No hard feelings. 
Just be glad it's not the Bee Movie script. -->

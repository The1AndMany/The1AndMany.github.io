Attention LRL personnel:

As you no doubt know, I have decided to make certain parts of this server public. Let me assure you again that there is no risk of secure information getting out. Every time a file goes public it has to be approved by KAI or myself. That's not what I want to talk about this time, though.

Today I would like to announce that the public interface is under construction. In the interest of keeping things simple for non-personnel, I have decided to code it myself only using conventions I know exist in the Branch I'm in right now. This means that it will take a while before the public interface is ready for a proper launch, but it also means that it will be much more understandable to the layman.

If you would like to help alpha test the site, you can reach it from the link on the internal portal. There isn't much yet, but what I do have could use some more sets of eyes. Keep in mind that I have designed this site in an aesthetic reminiscent of navigating a server on an old text-based interface, so it may be a little unfamiliar to some of you. If you have a better idea for how it should be designed, I'm all ears. As it stands right now it's just the building blocks I need to refine and expand it later.

Let me know what you think!

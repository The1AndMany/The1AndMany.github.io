<p>
<b>What is KAI?</b><br>
Normally, KAI is the artificial intelligence that runs the day-to-day operations of Low-Rez Labs. He is also a VoiceAttack profile meant for helping people fly in Elite: Dangerous.
</p>

<p>
<b>What does he do?</b><br>
KAI's features vary as he continues to get updated, but the majority of them can be summarized as "You can control your ship by saying specific commands."
</p>

<p>
<b>What do I need?</b><br>
All you need to run KAI is a microphone (preferrably a headset), a full version of <a href="https://voiceattack.com/">VoiceAttack</a>, and a copy of <a href="https://www.elitedangerous.com/">Elite: Dangerous</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>How do I install this?</b><br>
Please refer to README.txt for installation instructions.
</p>

<p>
<b>What's the difference between normal and "Lite" versions?</b><br>
"Lite" versions are built with as little dependency as possible. This makes it easier to set up, but also means some features aren't included.
</p>

<p>
<b>KAI is broken!</b><br>
Sorry to hear that. If Elite: Dangerous was just updated, it's probably because I haven't been able to update to the new version yet. If that's the case, try the latest "Lite" version out and see if it still works. Otherwise, <a href="mailto:EDKAI@lowrezlabs.net">email me</a> and I'll look into it. Please be as specific as possible, and provide steps to replicate the issue you're having. I can't respond directly, but I do read everything I get and am willing to email you from my personal email address if I need any additional information.
</p>

<p>Still have a question? <a href="mailto:EDKAI@lowrezlabs.net">Send me an email!</a> Unfortunately I can't respond to any emails directly, but I do read them all!</p>

Progress notes: The page is in the proper font and the text is centered vertically and horizontally, but if the screen is too small (i.e. mobile) you can't access some of the buttons.
Ideas: I may be able to look at the code at zenuel.com/anubis.html to figure out how to properly display on mobile screens, as that site works perfectly on mobile.
After that: Backgrounds and intro animations (I may be able to look to Anubis again for the latter)

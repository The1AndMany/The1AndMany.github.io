Progress notes: The page is in the proper font, the text is centered horizontally and vertically, the download links are divs set on the same line, the text adapts to screen/window size, some initial backgrounds are set, and the page adapts to small-screen edge cases, but it seems that the mobile page extends the height somewhat, which ruins the vertical centering.
Ideas: I may have to test this on an actual mobile screen, rather than desktop Chrome's F12 interface. The problem is I'm still not sure how to access the localhost server on anything but the host computer. I'll work on figuring that out first, then once I can load it on my phone I'll check to see if my phone does the same.
After that: Changing backgrounds via JavaScript and intro animations (I may be able to look to Anubis again for how to code the latter, and I plan on making it look as much like the actual Holo-interfaces in Elite Dangerous)

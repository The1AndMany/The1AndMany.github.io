<!--
Progress notes: The page is in the proper font, the text is centered horizontally and vertically, the download links are divs set on the same line, and the text adapts to screen/window size, but if the window is made small enough to cause overflow you can't scroll up
Ideas: I'm still getting to grips with the "flex" standard. I'll keep experimenting...
After that: Backgrounds and intro animations (I may be able to look to Anubis again for the latter)

Progress notes: Layout for both the Homepage and FAQ is more or less done.
Next up: Changing backgrounds via JavaScript
	Note: It might be cool to give users an option to send in screenshorts/art I could use as a background
		I'd have to put in a place where you could view all available backgrounds
			I think I'd put that there anyway...
			How do I do that without server-side code?
				I should look into code that adapts a webpage based on the contents of the folder it's in.
				Worst-case scenario, I just have to hard-code the entire thing and add onto it manually every time I get more backgrounds
		I'd probably need a disclaimer on the submission form saying that it'll need to be under a BY-SA license (or whatever the blanket license is for the site) or public domain, and pointing out that anyone with basic understanding of HTML will likely know how to download it direclty.
	Note: Do I really need RNG for the background changer? I might be able to get away with just sequential changing and a "next background" button
	Note: I should set it up so that the background is saved between the Homepage and FAQ
		I may just copy what I had in line for the link color changer where, unless you're using the default, it changes the appropriate links to add a url argument which triggers a differend DOM
			I'd have to adapt the trigger. I don't want to trigger the intro animation by refreshing every time you click the button.
After that: Intro animations (I may be able to look to Anubis again for how to code the latter, and I plan on making it look as much like the actual Holo-interfaces in Elite Dangerous)
	Note: Could I possibly have clicking on the specific link that leads to the FAQ trigger a transition animation?
		Maybe by checking the browser history and having the animation be different for the FAQ page if the last page was the Homepage?
		Not a high priority. I could probably get away with not having animations on the FAQ page

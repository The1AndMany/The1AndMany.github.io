Progress notes: The page is in the proper font, the text is centered horizontally and vertically, the download links are divs set on the same line, the text adapts to screen/window size, and some initial backgrounds are set, but if the window is made small enough to cause overflow you can't scroll up
Ideas: I'm still getting to grips with the "flex" standard. First I'll check to see if that's an unreasonable edge case, and if it isn't I'll keep experimenting...
After that: Changing backgrounds via JavaScript and intro animations (I may be able to look to Anubis again for how to code the latter, and I plan on making it look as much like the actual Holo-interfaces in Elite Dangerous)

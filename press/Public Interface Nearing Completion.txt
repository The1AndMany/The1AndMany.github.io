Attention LRL personnel:

After a few Lab months, the public interface is nearly ready! All that's really left is peer-review. If you're reading this and the site hasn't gone live yet, you can help with that. Simply visit the site through the link on the internal portal, review everything you care to, and let me or KAI know what you think. I'm pretty proud of the public interface, but I know there's always room for improvement.

I could use feedback on everything, but here's a few specific things I'm looking for focused feedback on.
* Everything in the case archives
* How well ED KAI works (You'll need Elite: Dangerous and Voice Attack to test that)
* The general aesthetic

Also, as I've said before, nothing goes on this site without approval from me or KAI. It's also worth mentioning that we will never push something to the public interface without the permission of the personnel member(s) who were responsible for it. I realize this has been a controversial decision, but I would never do something that infringes on the rights of those who work for Low-Rez Labs.

Thanks for all of your critisism so far. I have taken it all into account. Here's hoping I continue to get that constructive feedback, even after this site launches.

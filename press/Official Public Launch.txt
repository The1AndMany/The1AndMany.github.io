Attention LRL personnel:

Thanks for helping iron out the last few bugs in the public interface. By the time you're reading this, the site will be public. That being said, allow me to turn my attention to those just finding this site for the first time:

Welcome! My name is Samuel Henthorne, and I run an extradimensional research lab. I'm sure what exactly that is will become clearer with time, but for now, please enjoy this website. I've posted a few of our Case Archives (with permission) and a few resources I've created for the game Elite: Dangerous. There's more than this, of course, but clearing content for public access takes time. I'll be adding what I can when I can, so check back some time. I'll be announcing every time content is added on my Twitter, @The1AndMany. If you have any feedback, I'm all ears. Send me a tweet or email me at contact@lowrezlabs.net. I can't actually respond to emails directly, but I promise I will read every single one until that becomes impossible.

Keep an eye out. There's always more to come...

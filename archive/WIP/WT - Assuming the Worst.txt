* Story is told from the perspective of a man named Harold, who recently broke up with a woman named Yulinda but still has feelings towards her
* Story begins at the local mall where Harold is working in the food court, when he spots Yulinda walking around with a man in a lab coat
* Yulinda and the guy in the lab coat get lunch together, and Harold starts to assume that the two are on a date, judging by how they appear to act
	* They don't get anything from the place Harold works at, and Harold assumes it's because she doesn't want to run into him again just yet
* A lot of the story consists of Harold stealing glances when he can (he is a little busy), then making assumptions based on what he sees
* When the two get up and leave to go shopping, Harold comes to the conclusion that the two might make a good couple, if their interactions today were anything to go by, and while a part of him wants Yulinda back, he's happy for them and knows better than to intervene
* Cut to that night, at Harold's apartment, when he gets a call from the police asking him to come in for questioning about Yulinda's death the previous day

LRL Link:
Anyone who actually works at LRL can probably hazard a mostly accurate guess as to what's going on, but since this file is being written for the lay man, I'm stating the obvious anyway. Yulinda did actually die the day before, but a version of her from another branch was chosen as a recruitment candidate. The man in the lab coat is an LRL personnel member demonstrating the Portals, and he chose to do this by visiting a timeline where there are lots of little differences and a couple of big obvious ones. One such difference is the selection of restaurants in the food court, but another difference that the LRL guy didn't take into account is that Yulinda did actually exist in this timeline and used to date someone who worked in that very same food court. Yulinda ended up declining to join LRL because she just didn't think she could handle it, but this near-miss is a testament to research every connection between those travelling through portals and the branches they go to, even if the travellers haven't portalled to that branch yet. There's always a risk of a pre-existing connection caused by an alternate version of you.
	Also, just so its clear, Harold thought to mention to the police that he saw Yulinda after she supposedly died, but decided not to because the woman he thought was Yulinda may have looked like her from afar but acted differently to the Yulinda he knew, so he chalked it up to mistaken identity. If he had mentioned it things might have gotten messy.

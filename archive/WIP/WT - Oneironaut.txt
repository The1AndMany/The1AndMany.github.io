What to change:
* Change the title
	* That can come last
* The experiment of writing with no proper nouns and only gender-neutral pronouns seems to be a resounding failure. It makes the story sound too "smart" and not relatable enough. I want to keep the plot, but the way I tell it should be more conventional
	* That would allow me to use "partner", "significant other", and "boy/girlfriend" interchangably, in turn allowing me to refer to that character in a way that's much easier to read
	* I should also try to cut down on my use of pronouns by phrasing things differently
		* Ex: Steve was usually excited to fall asleep. Being an oneironaut and having the ability to control his dreams meant he could usually fantasize about anything he wanted, and he often did.
			* Eliminates one pronoun use, while also characterizing the oneironaut with a name and gender
* The term "oneironaut" should have a definition or explanation the first time it's used
	* I still really want to use it more than once
* The past/present/future tense gambit seems to work well, but is also slightly tacky; maybe I should just stick to one tense
	* I can use this technique in another story where it won't be as tacky and might acutally feed into the story's narrative
* The bad memories should be worse
	* What if the SO had a miscarriage
	* What if one or both parents were abusive?
		* Sexually, physically, verbally, and/or emotionally
	* Idea stolen from Forensic Files: The oneironaut is actually a middle child. Their parents wanted a child of one gender so badly they didn't care for their children of the opposite gender, so when the first and third children were the wrong gender, one or both parents killed the oneironaut's siblings
		* After birth, not an abortion
		* I'd probably have to give the oneironaut a gender in order to pull this off so I can say "brother" or "sister" instead of "sibling" and explicitly say which gender the parents wanted

The oneironaut was usually excited to fall asleep. Their ability to control their dreams meant they could usually fantasize about anything they wanted to, and they often did. But ever since that night, they dreaded falling asleep so much that they became an insomniac. Rather ironic. That night, the oneironaut went to bed as usual. As always, their dream guide showed up almost as soon as they started dreaming. The oneironaut was so experienced that they didn't need the dream guide's help to figure out they were dreaming. This came as the result of years of practice, and even now it's at the point that beginner oneironauts have no idea how they just know they're dreaming. Once the dream guide helped stabilize the dream, the two had some fun. The oneironaut had planned to explore their dreamscape and develop it further, but just as they were getting started the dream guide disappeared.

The oneironaut didn't notice at first, but once they did they knew something was wrong. As if on cue, the dreamscape started to melt away, and the oneironaut could feel themselves losing control of the dream around them. Next thing they knew, they were running for their life from something. They later realized they didn't know what it was, just that they were afraid of it. Whatever it was, it was faster than the oneironaut. When it caught up with them, they found themselves slowly enveloped in severe sharp pain all over. At its worst, it felt like they were drowning in boiling acid at the same time as a flesh-eating bacteria was eating them from the inside out. Desparate, the oneironaut willed themselves awake. They woke with a start, and found that they had been screaming in their sleep and woke their significant other. After hearing what happened, the significant other tried to soothe the oneironaut. They were both really worried, but thought that it was just a one-time thing. After a while, the two fell back asleep, first the significant other, then the oneironaut. The oneironaut's dream that followed was even worse.

Over the course of the next few weeks, the oneironaut's dreams got worse every time they fell asleep. It got so bad that they quickly became an insomniac. The significant other frequently expressed concern, and pointed out that nobody can stay awake for long periods of time and still think straight. In worst case scenarios, lack of sleep can even lead to death. The oneironaut was concerned too, but the nightmares when they couldn't help but fall asleep were so horrible that they said they would rather risk dying than fall back asleep. Perhaps they weren't thinking straight because of lack of sleep, but that is genuinely what they believed at that time. Unfortunately for the oneironaut, their brain couldn't help but fall asleep, often at the worst times. Every time they did, they had a horrible nightmare, worse than the last one. Once or twice, they thought the nightmares couldn't get any worse, but the human imagination is a force to be reckoned with. To the oneironaut's relief, they were still able to will themself awake, but they weren't sure how much longer that would last, nor which would end first: their nightmares or their ability to escape them.

It's midnight, one month after the nightmares began, and the oneironaut avoids falling asleep again. They fight the drowsiness, but it's ultimately futile. As soon as the drowsiness lifts, they realize something is wrong. They walk to the living room, careful not to wake the significant other. Suddenly, the TV turns itself on. To the oneironaut's surprise, the dream guide appeared through the static. Upon seeing such a familiar sight, the oneironaut immediately realizes they're dreaming, then almost will themselves awake. The dream guide stops the oneironaut, urging that running forever won't work. The oneironaut yells at the dream guide, asking where they've been for the past month. The dream guide explains that something was preventing them from appearing, and that they aren't even sure how long appearing like this will work. They quickly blurt out their message: If the oneironaut wants to end the nightmares they have to face them head on, find the cause, and confront that cause, whatever it is. The oneironaut says they don't think they're stong enough, and asks the dream guide for help. As if to answer, the TV goes dark. The oneironaut is tempted to wake themselves up despite the dream guides warnings, but they know the dream guide was right. Waking up would just delay the inevitable. Their only choice is to fight.

Almost immediately after the TV went dark, so did everything else. Enveloped in a black void, the oneironaut felt a fear impulse run up their spine. It took all of their will, but they were able to overcome this impulse by reminding themselves that as real as the pain feels, it is all just a dream. The void slowly lights up with glowing red eyes, starting off neutral but turning angry, as if infuriated by the oneironaut's ability to not be afraid. The oneironaut is determined to end this, once and for all. The eyes disappear and the oneironaut feels themselves falling. The oneironaut knows that they should be afraid of dying from the landing, but they know that even if they don't die the shock of the pain will just wake them up. As if the dream realized what the oneironaut was thinking, the sensation of falling stops. The oneironaut realizes that they might be able to avoid anything bad happening by not being afraid of anything bad happening. This strengthens their resolve.

The dream seems to realize that it can't scare the oneironaut with just the possibility something bad might happen anymore, so it decides to make something bad actually happen. Perhaps it thinks that the oneironaut is no longer afraid of the future, so maybe it can make him afraid of the present. A burning sensation slowly creeps along the oneironaut's skin. Over the course of about a minute, it ramps up significantly, to the point that it actually feels to the oneironaut like they're in the sun's core. The oneironaut is unafraid. The burning sensation seeps through their skin, and pretty soon every part of them hurts, inside and out. The oneironaut is unfazed. They know the pain can't get any worse without waking them up, and they know the dream knows. After a moment, the burning sensation suddenly stops. The oneironaut knows that they're one step closer to being able to enjoy their dreams again, and the thought of that makes them even more driven.

With the future and present not causing fear, the dream is forced to delve into the oneironaut's past. The oneironaut finds themselves reliving the most horrible moments in their life. First they are on stage at their middle school talent show on the day they injured their closest friend in front of the whole school. They let the scene play out. They know that it was probably for the better that they stopped being friends, because that friend later ended up dying of a drug overdose. Next they are at a bar on their 21st birthday. They feel smug, knowing that they ended up blackout drunk and thinking that there's nothing this memory could embarass them with without making something up. The scene shifted to them waking up the next morning, hungover and naked in the middle of the desert. Turns out there was something to be embarassed about, but the oneironaut stayed focused. They learned from that night and never let themselves drink that much again. Once again, the scene shifts and they end up in a car with their late father. The oneironaut knows exactly what is about to happen, but they've already gone through the grieving process. They were 8, so there's really nothing they could have done to prevent what's about to happen again. Besides, if the father was still alive, they would never have moved out-of-state and therefore never met the significant other. Standing in the face of their past makes the oneironaut move past determination; now they're defiant. The dream has tried past, present, and future to strike fear into them, and now they're yelling at the dream, asking if that's all the dream has.

As it turns out, they're right. The dream has run out of ammunition, and that gives the oneironaut an upperhand. It gives them some control. They choose not to waste it; it's their turn to cause fear, and they have an idea just how to do it. The dream materializes in front of the oneironaut, a dark shadowy figure. The oneironaut flips the script. They trap the dream in pitch blackness, then proceed to add glowing red eyes. For good measure, they add the sensation of falling and make the eyes fly upwards rapidly. The dream is scared now, and losing control over itself. The oneironaut isn't done yet. They add a burning sensation that penetrates the dream, making it hurt inside and out. The dream begs the oneironaut to stop. The oneironaut refuses. They know that the dream should just be a part of them, and the memories they chose are probably scary to that particular part. They get creative, and stick the dream in a car with their old friend playing the role of their dad with an excruciating hangover. With past, present, and future combined, the dream can't take much more of this.

The oneironaut stops the torture to try to reason with the dream. To their surprise, the dream has taken the form of their significant other. They ask why it did that, and get a response explaining that the dream was sick of not being in control of itself anymore. They ponder this for a while. Normally that explanation would be easy to take, but why had the dream taken the form of the significant other? Maybe their subconscious was trying to tell them something? But what? The oneironaut asks why the dream took that form. The dream says that their subconscious might be choosing this form because they don't entirely trust the significant other, whether they realize it consciously or not. The oneironaut dismisses this, thinking that maybe the dream has no idea what's going on because it's not in control anymore and that's its best guess. The oneironaut strikes a deal: The oneironaut and the dream swap control every other night, and they both agree to make the dreams tolerable to the one not in control. The dream agrees, and asks who gets control tonight. The dream guide shows up and suggests that, as a sign of good faith, the dream get control on the understanding that what it makes should be pleasant. The dream agrees and disappears. The oneironaut turns to the dream guide and tries to thank it, but the dream guide insists that it was all in their newly-found willpower. The scene shifts and the oneironaut and the dream guide have some fun together in what time there is before they wake up.

Tomorrow morning, the oneironaut will wake pleasantly with their own circadian rhythm. The significant other will notice that the oneironaut didn't wake up screaming in the middle of the night again, and ask how they're doing. The oneironaut won't be able to shake what the dream said about their subconscious not trusting the significant other. Now that they've been made consciously aware of their subconscious distrust, they can't stop thinking about it. The oneironaut gives a story about finally standing up to the dream and flipping the script, making sure to leave out the sensitive details, including the memories and anything involving the significant other. The significant other smiles. They can't help but be happy for the oneironaut facing their fears. If the old saying is anything to go by, that'll just make them a stronger person. The significant other will leave for work, while the oneironaut will stay home, as it will be their day off. They will spend the entire day reflecting on what happened last night. The significant other will be right; the oneironaut will be a stronger person because of all this. They just won't realize exactly how. Not until it's too late.

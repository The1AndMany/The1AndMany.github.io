Plan for expansion: Elaborate on the mother's life

	My mother has died. This is a sad day, and the giants seem to be affected as well. They show it differently, of course. They show everything differently. In any case, I hope that my mother can live on in my thoughts. She once told me stories of what other, more horrible giants did to her father. She told me stories of how she didn't trust the giants who took her in. I may be biased because I've known them my whole life, but I can't imagine not trusting them. A lot has happened since those days, though. The smallest giant has grown, and is now just as large as the others. The family has moved several times, for reasons I have yet to understand. I also now wonder whether they are immortal, as my mother was a small child when they took her in. Yet as much as things have changed, some things remain, even after my mother's death. The formerly smallest giant still enjoys having me nearby as they rest. I am well-fed and taken care of. Occasionally we pay visits to a giant cloaked in white who takes much more interest in me than the other giants. I reflect on my mother's father's life, or at least what I've heard of it. My mother has always insisted that some giants do enjoy making my kind fight, but I take that statement with healthy skepticism. Provided it's true, it shows that how the giants treat us varies wildly. In any case, after realizing that these giants are different than the ones she told horror stories about, my mother tried to show them as much compassion as they show us. I intend to honor her legacy by continuing that behavior as a tradition, and hope I can pass it on to my eventual children.

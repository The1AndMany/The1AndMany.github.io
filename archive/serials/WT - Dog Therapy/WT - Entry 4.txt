Plan for expansion: Expand on the owner's life

	My ancestor once told his children that she was immortal. They, in turn told their children, and so our family had thought her immortal for so long. She has guarded my family for generations, since the days of my great-great-great-great-great-great-grandmother. She has kept us safe, well-fed, and taken care of. We had thought that maybe these giants could prolong their life by being nice, both to each other and to my kind. But now I know better. Just as my pelt grows gray, my bones grow weak, and my thoughts grow dim, so too do hers. Her children have children of their own now, some of whom have taken in my offspring. But she has left none for herself. I will be her last. Just as there are white-cloaked giants who make me feel better, there are some that try to make her feel better. But we haven't seen any in so long. They know we will both die soon, and that there's nothing they can do. We still get visitors. Mostly her children, but also other giants who help her with tasks I'm told she could once do herself. It's so tragic that a life so long must eventually end, and it saddens me to think that day may come soon. For all of her knowledge and compassion, she is not immortal. I wonder whether she will accept her fate or keep fighting until the bitter end. Whatever her decision, I've made a decision of my own: I will comfort her. Either until I can no longer comfort or she can no longer be comforted, I will comfort her. She showed compassion towards my family for generations, and it is only fitting that she recieve whatever compassion she can from those around her, whether they share her species or not. My ancestor started a tradition of honoring his mother by showing the same compassion towards these giants as we recieve. I hope this final act does her memory justice.

Plan for expansion: Expand on the writer's life

	I grow old. My pelt grows gray and my joints ache when I walk. And yet she remains untouched by the passage of time. She remains as youthful and energetic as she was when I was born. These immortal giants must age slowly, as I have seen her give birth to her children and they are still smaller than she is. They grow every day, but they have yet to catch up. I enjoyed playing with them when they were about my size, but even the youngest now towers over me. At best, I could only come up to their waist. But that was before. My faculties are decaying. My children worry for my health. I know I am not going to last much longer. The visits to the white-cloaked giants were becoming more frequent, and sometimes I would stay for several nights, but now they have stopped. It occurs to me they may have done all they can to prolong my life, and only wish for me to pass on in peace rather than under the harsh lighting and constant prodding of their realm. I accept this, but worry for my children's well-being. Will she be as kind to them as she was to me? Will they show her the same appreciation I have taught them to show? What about their children? I suppose it doesn't really matter, in the grand scheme of things. My thoughts are hard to focus now. I suspect I will not wake up tomorrow. All I can think to do now is spend my last few moments comforting her. Hopefully this will convince her to treat my family well for many generations to come.

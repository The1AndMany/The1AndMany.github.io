Years pass.
He is now a young boy. He lives with his mother.
He goes to school. His obligation has become a hassle.

He lives his life.
Doing his chores.
Playing his games.
Grieving his father.
Growing strong.

Does he suspect anything? Can he even see me?

No. I suppose not.
He is only a child. How could he understand?

Perhaps he just needs some nudging.
I give him a friend. He pays no mind.
I give him some reprieve. He takes it for granted.
I take away his good times. He takes refuge in his games.

His body is not ready for the pain.
His mind is not ready for the truth.
He is not ready.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Years pass.
He is now a grown man. He lives alone.
He makes games. His refuge has become his livelihood.

He lives his life.
Doing his job.
Playing his work
Grieving his innocence.
Growing old.

Does he suspect anything? Can he even see me?

No. I suppose not.
He wasn't ready before. Why would he be ready now?

Perhaps he just needs some nudging.
I give him a wife. He leaves her at the altar.
I give him some extra cash. He doesn't spend it.
I take away his job. He leeches money from his family.

His body is not ready for the pain.
His mind is not ready for the truth.
He is not ready.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Years pass.
He is now an old man. He lives in a glorified hospital.
He regrets his decisions. His life has become his burden.

He lives his life.
Doing his drugs.
Playing his crosswords.
Grieving his youth.
Growing weak.

Does he suspect anything? Can he even see me?

Yes. I suppose so.
He has had plenty of time. How could he still need more?

Perhaps he just needs some nudging.
I take away his family. He regrets not loving them more.
I take away his independence. He starts missing the good ol' days.
I give him some hope. He cherishes what little he has.

His body is ready for the pain.
His mind is ready for the truth.
He is ready.

For me.

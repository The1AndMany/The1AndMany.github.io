<h1> Welcome to Low-Rez Labs!</h1>

<p>This website is still under construction. I could ask certain co-workers of mine to make this website for me, but I like to do things myself. As of this writing I haven't added any stories to the site yet, and I'm mostly dusting off the cobwebs of my coding skills. In time, this website will act as a file server for all of the stories I "write". You're welcome to look at what I have so far, but I can almost guarantee it won't be pretty.</p>
<p>If you want to know first when this website is ready for a proper public launch, follow me on <a href=https://twitter.com/The1AndMany>Twitter</a> or <a href=https://www.furaffinity.net/user/gameon123/>FurAffinity</a>. When this site launches, I'll be sure to post announcements on those two sites at the very least.</p>
<p><b>Fair warning:</b> My coding skills are a little rusty. In particular I'm having trouble figuring out how to make this site look good on mobile devices while preserving the new-old-school aesthetic I'm going for. Feel free to shoot me some advice!</p>
<p>Thanks for visiting!</p>

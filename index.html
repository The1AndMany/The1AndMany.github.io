<h1> Welcome to Low-Rez Labs!</h1>

<p>This website is still under construction. I could ask certain co-workers of mine to make this website for me, but I like to do things myself. As of this writing I've only added a small handful of content, but I plan to add more before a public launch. In time, this website will catalog all of the stories I "write" and any side projects I publish. You're welcome to look at what I have so far, but be sure to take the quality of content with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>If you want to know first when this website is ready for a proper public launch, follow me on <a href=https://twitter.com/The1AndMany>Twitter</a> or <a href=https://www.furaffinity.net/user/gameon123/>FurAffinity</a>. When this site launches, I'll be sure to post announcements on those two sites at the very least.</p>
<p>Thanks for visiting!</p>

<p><b>NOTE TO INTERNET EXPLORER USERS:</b><br>
IE processes most monospace fonts in such a way that the formatting of this website will be displayed incorrectly. I've set a font that doesn't do this to be used by default, but if that font can't be displayed this site will not look its best.<br>
You can check whether the formatting is correct by hitting Ctrl+A and checking whether every line (except possibly the last one) is the same width. If the lines are of different widths the formatting is incorrect; please consider using an alternative browser such as Firefox or Google Chrome.</p>
